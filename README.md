I find this article about the PS5 Pro to be interesting because of the new specs the PS5 Pro will have, but also because of the implications of one of the new features. The PS5 Pro will supposedly render graphics 45% faster than the PS5 as well as utilize AI to sharpen graphics. However, this spec improvement comes at a massive price increase of $200, which a lot of people do not consider worth the price. Another problem is that there is no disk reader that comes with the console, thus people will need to pay even more in order to use the game disks they bought.
