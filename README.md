I find this article about the PS5 Pro to be interesting because of the new specs the PS5 Pro will have, but also because of the implications of one of the new features. The PS5 Pro will supposedly render graphics 45% faster than the PS5 as well as utilize AI to sharpen graphics. However, this spec improvement comes at a massive price increase of $200, which a lot of people do not consider worth the price. Another problem is that there is no disk reader that comes with the console, thus people will need to pay even more in order to use the game disks they bought.

*Contribution from Kahmeeah Obey:* I don’t own a PS5, but I thought this article was still interesting because I can see how this decision is going to divide people. A lot of people will most likely be mad at first, but eventually, they’ll probably buy the extra parts or new machine anyway because of FOMO. It reminds me of when Apple removed the headphone jack—people were upset, but now wireless headphones are super common. I’m curious if this move will push more tech and software companies to do similar things. I also wonder how exactly they’re using AI to enhance the graphics.
